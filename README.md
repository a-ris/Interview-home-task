Notes app is a simple app that allows user to create and delete notes, reminders and other text
information.
Use cases:
1. User opens the app, and sees list of notes he/she created.
2. User wants to create new note, so, he/she writes some text and clicks 'Create Note'. Then user sees
that new note was added to the list.
3. User wants to delete some note, so, user clicks on remove button, which is placed near the note.
Then note is removed from the list.
Requirements:

4. State management (i.e. storing/creating/removing notes) should be implementing using Redux
